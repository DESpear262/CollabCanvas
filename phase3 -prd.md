# CollabCanvas Phase 3 - Point Optimization PRD

## Project Overview
With Phase 1 (MVP) and Phase 2 (AI Integration) complete, Phase 3 focuses on strategically adding features to maximize rubric points. This is a **point-farming exercise** - we implement the highest ROI features that push your score from ~88 points to 95+ points.

**Deadline:** Sunday (Final Submission)  
**Current Estimated Score:** 88-92 points  
**Target Score:** 95-100 points (Exceptional/A+)  
**Strategy:** High-impact, low-effort features that directly address rubric gaps

---

## Current State Analysis

### Strong Areas (Don't Touch):
- ✅ Section 1: Collaborative Infrastructure (27-30 pts)
- ✅ Section 4: AI Canvas Agent (20-25 pts)
- ✅ Section 5: Technical Implementation (9-10 pts)
- ✅ Section 6: Documentation (5 pts)

### Opportunity Areas (Focus Here):
- ⚠️ Section 2: Performance & Scalability (currently 15-17 pts, max 20 pts)
- ⚠️ Section 3: Advanced Features (currently 6-12 pts, max 15 pts)
- ⚠️ Bonus Points (currently 0-2 pts, max 5 pts)

**Gap to close: 8-13 points**

## Testing Strategy for Phase 3

### Must Test:
- [ ] Multi-select with 5+ objects
- [ ] Undo/Redo chain of 10+ operations
- [ ] Performance with 500+ objects at 60 FPS
- [ ] Keyboard shortcuts with and without selection
- [ ] Copy/paste across different selections
- [ ] Layer ordering with overlapping objects
- [ ] Group operations (move, resize, delete)

### Demo Video Checklist:
- [ ] Show multi-user collaboration (2 browsers)
- [ ] Demonstrate 6+ AI commands (creation, manipulation, layout, complex)
- [ ] Show keyboard shortcuts in action
- [ ] Demonstrate undo/redo
- [ ] Show 500+ objects performing smoothly
- [ ] Highlight advanced features (grouping, alignment)
- [ ] Explain architecture briefly
- [ ] Show connection status and reconnection

---

## Risk Mitigation

### High-Risk Features (Could Break Things):
- **Undo/Redo** - Can conflict with real-time sync
  - Mitigation: Only track local operations, sync final state
  
- **Grouping** - Complex with Firestore structure
  - Mitigation: Simple group object with child IDs, keep it basic

- **Performance at 500+ objects** - Might reveal bottlenecks
  - Mitigation: Test early, have optimization plan ready

### Time Sinks to Avoid:
- ❌ Perfect UI design (good enough > perfect)
- ❌ Complex animations (simple > fancy)
- ❌ Over-engineering grouping (basic > sophisticated)
- ❌ Debugging edge cases (happy path > bulletproof)

## Key Principles

1. **Points Over Perfection** - Working features > polished features
2. **Test Early** - Don't wait until Sunday to test 500 objects
3. **Stay Modular** - Don't break existing functionality
4. **Document Everything** - Video and README sell the work
5. **Time Box** - If a feature takes >3 hours, move on

**Absolute Must-Do (12 hours):**
1. Multi-select (2h)
2. Keyboard shortcuts (2h)
3. Undo/Redo (3h)
4. Performance testing (2h)
5. Copy/Paste (2h)
6. Connection status (1h)

10. Export PNG (1h)

**Polish If Time (6 hours):**
11. Alignment tools (2h)
12. Animations (2h)
13. UI polish (2h)

**Total Time: 26 hours over 3 days = Very achievable**
