# Progress — CollabCanvas

## What Works
- Deployed app accessible at production URL
- Firebase email/password authentication
- Multiplayer cursors with labels and presence list
- Canvas with pan/zoom at 60 FPS under typical load
- Shapes: rectangles, circles, text boxes; create/move/resize/delete
- Firestore persistence with real-time synchronization between users

## AI Status (Phase 2)
- OpenAI client integrated; tool schemas and executor/planner implemented
- Basic function-calling flows working in tests; integration under refinement
- Target coverage: 6+ command types including at least 1 complex plan

## What’s Left
- Verify end-to-end AI chat flow in the UI after `ChatPanel` changes
- Expand tests for `planner.ts` multi-step scenarios and failure handling
- Performance test script (500 objects) and `docs/PERFORMANCE.md`
- Optional: color picker UI, undo/redo, z-order management polish

## Known Issues / Watchlist
- Cursor mirror offsets under extreme pan/zoom need validation
- Mid-drag streaming jitter can appear under high latency
- Text editing hotkeys may conflict with canvas shortcuts

## Recent Work
- Memory bank restored (project brief, product context, system patterns, tech context, active context, this progress)
- AI services and `useAI` hook updated; ChatPanel removed pending replacement

## Next Milestones
- Pass core AI integration tests and manual E2E checks
- Document performance results and finalize Phase 2 Definition of Done
