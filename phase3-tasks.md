# CollabCanvas Phase 3 - Parallel Task Blocks

## Overview
Tasks organized into **dependency chains** that can be worked in parallel. Each block is independent unless explicitly marked with prerequisites.

**Total Implementation Time:** ~26 hours over 3 days  
**Parallelization:** Up to 3-4 blocks can run simultaneously

---

## ðŸ”´ BLOCK A: Selection Foundation Chain
**Dependencies:** None - Start immediately  
**Total Time:** 4 hours  
**Critical Path:** Required for many other features

---

### PR #24: Multi-Select Infrastructure (Blender-style)
**Prerequisites:** None  
**Time:** 3â€“4 hours  
**Impact:** +1-2 points (Section 2), unlocks BLOCK B and BLOCK E

#### Tasks:
- [x] Selection state foundation exists via `SelectionContext`
- [ ] Wire `SelectionContext` into `src/components/Canvas/Canvas.tsx`; comment out legacy `selectedId/selectedKind` usages for rollback
- [ ] Add west-pinned selection toolbar
  - [ ] Primary mode: point | rectangle | lasso (Shift cycles)
  - [ ] Boolean mode: new | union | intersect | difference (Tab cycles)
  - [ ] Show selected-count chip when >1 selected
- [ ] Point-select: top-most by z; blank click clears
- [ ] Rectangle-select (marquee): intersect rule, live update, 5px threshold, cancel on RMB/outside
- [ ] Lasso-select: polygon live update; intersect rule
- [ ] Boolean modes applied across point/area: new, union, intersect, difference
- [ ] Selection persists across pan/zoom; MMB pans without affecting selection
- [ ] Selection tool is selection-only (no move/resize/rotate)
- [ ] Pan tool attaches Transformer to current selection; allow multi-rotate about selection centroid; disable group resize
- [ ] Text edit resumes prior multi-selection after blur/click-away

#### Files Created:
- `src/components/Canvas/SelectionToolbar.tsx`
- `src/components/Canvas/Marquee.tsx`
- `src/components/Canvas/Lasso.tsx`

- `src/components/Canvas/Rectangle.tsx` / `Circle.tsx` / `TextBox.tsx` - optional lightweight selection visuals

#### Testing (Manual):
- [ ] Point/rect/lasso work with new/union/intersect/difference
- [ ] Click blank canvas clears selection
- [ ] Live marquee/lasso updates and cancels correctly
- [ ] Selection persists across pan/zoom and MMB pan
- [ ] Returning from text edit restores multi-selection

#### Validation:
- [ ] Blender-style selection UX implemented
- [ ] Boolean modes behave as specified
- [ ] Transformer appears only in pan tool; multi-rotate works; no group resize

## Recommended Execution Strategy

### Day 1 (8 hours):
**Parallel Work:**
- Start BLOCK A (4h) - Critical path
- Start BLOCK C (3h) - While waiting on BLOCK A
- Start BLOCK F (3h) - While waiting on BLOCK A

**End of Day:** PRs #24, #25, #28, #33 complete

---

### Day 2 (10 hours):
**Parallel Work:**
- Start BLOCK B (3h) - Depends on BLOCK A done
- Start BLOCK D (4h) - Independent
- Start BLOCK E (4h) - Depends on PR #25 done
- Start BLOCK G (3h) - Independent

**End of Day:** PRs #26-32, #35, #36 complete

---

### Day 3 (4 hours):
- PR #34: Export (1h)
- Final testing (1h)
- Demo video (2h)

---

### Day 4 (2 hours):
- AI Development Log (1h)
- Final submission (1h)

## Point Projection by Day

**End of Day 1:** 
- Multi-select + Undo/Redo + Performance = +6-8 points
- **Score: 94-100 points**

**End of Day 2:**
- Keyboard shortcuts + Copy/Paste + Layer Management + Grouping + Alignment + Color Picker + Connection Status + Polish = +17-19 points
- **Score: 105+ points (capped at 105)**

**End of Day 3:**
- Export + Demo Video = +2 points + professional presentation
- **Final Score: 105 points (maximum possible)**

---

## Critical Success Factors

1. **Start BLOCK A immediately** - It's the critical path
2. **BLOCK C, D, F, G can all run in parallel** - Maximum efficiency
3. **Test each PR before moving to next** - Graceful failures only work if you catch them
4. **Don't optimize order** - Work on highest impact first
5. **Time box each PR** - If it takes >3h, move on

---

## Notes

- **Graceful Failures:** If a feature breaks, it shouldn't affect others. Each PR is isolated.
- **Dependencies Clearly Marked:** Check prerequisites before starting each PR
- **Parallel Optimization:** Up to 4 blocks can run simultaneously
- **Time Estimates:** Conservative - you finished Phase 2 in one day, you can do this

You've got the momentum. Let's lock in that 95-100 point score! ðŸš€
